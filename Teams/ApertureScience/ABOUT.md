More about us!

For most (if not all) of us, this is our first hackathon! We want a challenging, competative experience in which we can engage and learn as we work together to meet our project goal in providing a solution to one of the Koding.com themes.

* Super Bear) A back-end developer (PHP, MySQL,Mongo, Redis, some Python, some Shell) using Linux/mac.
* Tim) Full stack developer, own a web dev company, 10+ years experience (PHP/MySQL/JS/HTML/CSS). Other experience: Python, c/c++/c#, shell and some java.
* Cyril) Back-end developer

We're going to attack the challenges presented by the hackathon themes, collaborate and develop a creative, unique solution, and produce a useful product to meed the presented need.
