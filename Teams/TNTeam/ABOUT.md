TNTeam rocks!
=============

## Who we Are

TNTeam consists of a mix of experienced hacker veterans, promising
programming rising stars, and artists, all from Tunisia.  Some of us
know each other since quite a while now (Rafik and Mohamed were
classmates since high school), met during work (Rafik and Ibtissem
happen to be coworkers, Elyes was an intern in the company Rafik and
Ibtissem work in) or while attending Kendo training (Rafik and Chakib
are Kenshis). But all in all, TNTeam is made of close friends, that
all love hacking and fine arts.

* `Rafik` and `Mohamed` are Back-End Developers and
architects. They'll probably will write Clojure and Java. `Mohamed` is
an egg on twitter because he chose to. They began hacking since the
nineties, and were coding for living for fourteen years now.
* `Ibtissem` is an experienced Front-End infrastructure engineer,
though also having her word to say on back-end side of things. She
knows a couple of things about Clojure, Java, HTML5 and JS. She
accouns for three years experience.
* `Elyes` is a promising Web Developer, experienced in designing and
integrating cool web apps. He will learn a 2D JS Game framework for
this contest.
* `Chakib` is the artist of the team. He will create unique and
  amazing artwork for our project.

TNTeam already entered
[Clojure Cup 2014](https://clojurecup.com/#/people/teams), and ended
up third by public votes. So Close!

Here's what we all look like:

## So what are we cooking for you?

TNTeam fell in love with theme 4, which is about designing educational
html5 multiplayer game.

We'll be designing a HTML5 multiplayer strategy/action game to educate
and raise awareness about online privacy and security issues. We'll
try to show, by the means of a small wargame-like, how are people facing
various caveats regarding the ownership of material they share on
social networks, the security and confidentiality of their
communications, the tracing they are submitted when browsing, the
threats of theft of their sensitive data...

## Technologies

To be able to produce the game, we'll use a bunch of technologies:

- Web Server : nginx, httpkit (for services and websocket)

- Back end Platform: Clojure / Java 8

- Data Store : mongodb, Redis

- Front End : Phaser.io as a HTML5 game engine.

We'll be hosted at a local coworking space, Cogite. These guys were
awesome enough to allow us to meet and enter the hackathon in their
premices!
