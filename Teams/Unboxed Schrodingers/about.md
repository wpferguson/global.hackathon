We are a group of agile software developers that love learning while taking on an interesting challenge.

About our skills and what you are going to do?
=======
Our team has strong opinions about web accessibility, using technology to make the world a better place, and using good coding standards to make that happen. This year we plan on tackling the world of epidemiology by hoping to convince people around the world that small contributions can make a massive difference.

Between the three of us, we have plenty of years of professional development experience. Our team has a member on the core Ruby on Rails team, does frequent contributions to other open source projects, and love experimenting with different languages and programming related technologies.
