Team ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
===============

This is Team I-Didn't-Have-A-Better-Name-For-It or Team ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ for short.

I like web technologies, specifically building on top of already powerful services and extending them. For example, taking the WUndgeround weather API and using sunset time to turn the lights in my house on. Or by combining Rotten Tomatoes and Redbox to find critically acclaimed movies that I can immediately pick up (that is if I can be bothered to put on pants).

I move bits around.


My Skillz
=========

Like I said, I really like web technologies so I'll be developing in PHP5 with some Python as a backend, HTML5, and jQuery. Probably use Bootstrap since I'm a terrible designer

Right now, I'm thinking of visualizing or re-thinking how people look at some government data. Which agency's? And in what ways?
