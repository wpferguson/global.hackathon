Hi, i'm Pulpo, and i am proud to present our team 'Octomouse'. 

We are a bunch of friends, with a history of many years working and studying together.

I met Brain at tech school, we've been bench mates, and made many cool science fair projects toghether! Nowdays we are both teachers at the same school :)

Pinky and The Brain are best friends since forever, and they rocked the university together, they are now two awesome engineers.

We are all cubicle mates at our actual job, wich is great.
